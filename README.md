# Certificate Script
Automates the creation of certificates for our participants.

    How-To guide:
       1. Install python
            - If you don't have Microsoft Office, you'll need that too (for .docx Files)
       2. Clone repository
       3. Run "pip install -r requirements.txt" in the command line in the project root directory
       4. Create the spreadsheet
            - Clone the Template xlsx File and rename it "Bewertungen.xlsx"
       5. Run cert.py
            - Do that in you terminal (CMD) by running the command "python path/to/cert.py"
            - You can get the path to the folder by going there in your file browser and then clicking to the File (like a URL)
       6. Enjoy
       
It might take about 5-10 seconds per certificate, so don't worry if it takes a few minutes to finish.
